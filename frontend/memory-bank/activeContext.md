# Active Context: Pool Explorer - Column Width Alignment

This is done now.

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing infinite scroll for the "Pool list" table and applying the TC Design system's visual styles across the Pool List View components.

## Recent Changes

*   **Infinite Scroll Implementation:**
    *   **`src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx`**: Modified to accept an `onViewportScroll` prop, allowing external components to listen for scroll events on the underlying viewport.
    *   **`src/components/dexscan/ListView.tsx`**:
        *   Removed `currentPage` and `totalPages` state.
        *   Added `displayedPoolsCount` state to manage the number of currently visible pools.
        *   Added `isLoadingMore` state to control the loading indicator.
        *   Implemented `handleLoadMorePools` to increment `displayedPoolsCount` with a batch size, including a simulated delay for visual feedback of loading.
        *   Passed `displayedPools`, `onLoadMore`, `hasMorePools`, and `isLoadingMore` props to `PoolTable`.
        *   Removed the `TablePagination` component from rendering.
    *   **`src/components/dexscan/pools/PoolTable.tsx`**:
        *   Updated `PoolTableProps` to include `isLoadingMore`.
        *   Integrated the `onViewportScroll` prop from `ScrollArea` to detect when the user scrolls near the bottom of the table.
        *   Conditionally renders a "Loading more pools..." indicator at the bottom of the table when `isLoadingMore` is true and `hasMorePools` is true.
        *   Removed the `scrollViewportRef` and its associated `useEffect` for manual scroll listening, as `onViewportScroll` is now used.

*   **TC Design Styling Application:**
    *   **`src/components/dexscan/pools/PoolTable.tsx`**:
        *   Applied TC Design colors (`rgba(255,244,224,...)`, `#FFF4E0`) to text, backgrounds, and borders for table headers, summary row, and data rows.
        *   Updated column widths to match Figma specifications more precisely.
        *   Adjusted hover states for table rows.
        *   Updated sort icon colors.
    *   **`src/components/dexscan/common/TokenIcon.tsx`**: Updated background and border colors to match TC Design.
    *   **`src/components/dexscan/common/ProtocolLogo.tsx`**: Updated background, border, and text colors to match TC Design.
    *   **`src/components/dexscan/graph/BlockProgressIcon.tsx`**: Updated the default `color` prop to `#FF3366` as per TC Design.

## Next Steps

*   Verify the infinite scroll functionality and visual appearance in the running application.
*   Thoroughly test all filter and sorting functionalities to ensure they interact correctly with infinite scroll.
*   Review overall color scheme consistency across the application.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Adherence to Figma design specifications for UI elements, including dynamic sizing and color palette.
*   Use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   Modular component design.
*   Centralized state management for pool data via `PoolDataContext`.
*   Client-side timestamping for `updatedAt` on `Pool` objects.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   Successfully integrated infinite scroll using Radix UI's `ScrollArea` by extending its functionality with a custom `onViewportScroll` prop.
*   The importance of precise `SEARCH` blocks for `replace_in_file` operations, and the utility of `write_to_file` as a fallback for larger, more complex changes.
*   Consistent application of the TC Design color palette requires careful attention to `rgba` values and specific hex codes.
*   The `isLoadingMore` state provides crucial user feedback during asynchronous loading operations.
*   The `getColumnWidthClass` helper function in `PoolTable.tsx` was adjusted to reflect the new, more precise pixel-based widths from the `listViewUIRefactor.md` plan, moving away from `min-w` and `w-1/3` for most columns to ensure exact alignment with Figma.
