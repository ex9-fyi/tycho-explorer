# Active Context: Pool Explorer - Graph View Refactoring Review

## Current Work Focus

The primary task of refactoring the **Market Graph View** (`src/components/dexscan/graph/`) to align with the TC Design is now substantially complete. We are currently in a review phase, awaiting user feedback on the implemented changes and instructions for any further refinements or new tasks.

## Recent Changes

The following changes were implemented to refactor the Graph View and related components:

*   **Global Styling (`App.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented an app-wide, multi-layered background using downloaded Figma assets (dark purple base, comets, rays, noise texture) to ensure visual consistency across all views.
*   **`DexScanContent.tsx`:**
    *   Adjusted horizontal margins for the main content area to `mx-6` (24px) to match Figma panel placement.
    *   Modified the content container height to `calc(100vh - 104px)` for better viewport fit, with child views (`GraphViewContent`, `ListView`) taking `100%` of this calculated height.
*   **`GraphViewContent.tsx`:**
    *   Styled the main Graph View frame with Figma-specified background color (`rgba(255,244,224,0.02)`), background texture (`graph_frame_bg_artboard.png`), border (`1px solid rgba(255,244,224,0.4)`), rounded corners (`12px`), and backdrop-filter (`blur(24px)`).
    *   Implemented auto-rendering logic for the graph, triggering updates on filter changes. The manual "Render Graph" button and related handlers were removed.
    *   Refined edge styling logic to use default subtle colors/widths from `networkOptions` and apply specific styles for "protocol match" or "updated in current block" states.
    *   Removed the "Displaying X tokens and Y connections" text.
*   **`GraphControls.tsx`:**
    *   **Layout:** Converted to a single horizontal row, responsive (stacks on small screens). "Reset filters" text link moved to the left group.
    *   **Filter Displays (Tokens & Protocols):** Replaced old UI with styled clickable boxes showing "Select..." or comma-separated selections. Dropdown arrows now rotate on popover open/close. Token filter has a `LucideX` icon (in styled circular wrapper) to clear selections. Popovers align to the start of the trigger. Trigger buttons have `max-w-xs`.
    *   **Block Number Display:** Implemented with an animated circular progress icon (`BlockProgressIcon.tsx`) using Folly red (`#FF3366`) and the live block number.
    *   **Popover Content:**
        *   Frames styled per Figma (bg, border, radius, shadow, backdrop-filter).
        *   Token search bar styled per Figma, with auto-focus on open and dynamic Folly red border on focus (2px thick).
        *   List items styled (padding, hover bg). `formatTokenWithAddress` updated to return JSX for differential styling of symbol vs. address summary (address part smaller and lighter).
        *   Checkboxes styled with Tailwind classes to approximate Figma's red-filled checked state.
        *   "Done" button/footer removed from popovers; selections apply instantly.
        *   Entire list item rows made clickable for selection.
*   **`PoolDataContext.tsx`:**
    *   Enhanced to track `lastBlockTimestamp` and `estimatedBlockDuration` to support the animated block progress icon.
*   **`useGraphData.ts`:**
    *   Updated to pass through `lastBlockTimestamp` and `estimatedBlockDuration` from the context.
*   **`GraphView.tsx`:**
    *   **Nodes:** Default shape changed to "circle" with updated default styling (colors, font size). Selected nodes now correctly display a `2px solid #FF3366` border, managed by updating the node's data in the `DataSet`.
    *   **Edges:** Default styling (color, width, straight lines) defined in `networkOptions`.
    *   **Tooltip:** HTML content styled to match Figma design (bg, border, blur, shadow, text styles). Content is interim (Symbol, Pool Count, Address).
*   **New Component (`BlockProgressIcon.tsx`):** Created for the animated block progress display.

## Next Steps

1.  Await user feedback on the extensive Graph View refactoring and implemented fixes.
2.  Address any further refinements or bugs identified by the user.
3.  Proceed with new tasks as directed by the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations (Reflecting Implemented State)

*   **App-Wide Background:** Implemented globally.
*   **Graph View Frame:** Implemented with specified styling.
*   **Graph Controls:** Single-row, responsive layout. Styled filter triggers. Animated block display with Folly red progress.
*   **Auto-Rendering:** Implemented for graph updates.
*   **Node Styling:** Circles, text-only (no logos). Selected nodes: Folly red border.
*   **Edge Styling:** Subtle defaults, conditional highlighting, straight lines.
*   **Tooltip Content:** Interim (Symbol, Pools, Address), styled per Figma.
*   **Popover Styling:** Frame, search (with auto-focus & dynamic focus border), list items (including styled address summary), and checkbox styling implemented to match TC Design. "Done" buttons removed.
*   **Asset Management:** Figma assets stored in `src/assets/figma_generated/`. `icon_close_x.svg` was not downloadable; `LucideX` used instead.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Adherence to `.clinerules` maintained.
*   **Iterative refinement based on user feedback has been key.**

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   Successfully translated complex Figma designs into functional React components, including nuanced styling for transparency, blurs, and dynamic states.
*   The process of iterative feedback and refinement is crucial for aligning with user expectations and catching subtle design details (e.g., selected node border color, popover behaviors, block timer animation).
*   Managing component state for interactive styling (e.g., `isSearchFocused` for border changes) is a common pattern.
