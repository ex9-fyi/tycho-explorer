# Active Context: Pool Explorer - Column Width Alignment

This is done now.

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on ensuring the "Pool list" table's column widths in the application precisely match the dynamic sizing behavior specified in the Figma design. This involves moving away from fixed-width columns to a more flexible layout where the "Tokens" column expands and other columns fit their content.

## Recent Changes

*   **`src/components/dexscan/pools/PoolTable.tsx`**:
    *   The table layout was changed from `table-fixed` to `table-auto`.
    *   A new helper function, `getColumnWidthClass`, was introduced to dynamically apply Tailwind CSS width classes to each `TableHead` element.
    *   This function assigns `min-w-[240px] w-1/3` to the 'tokens' column to allow it to fill available space, and specific pixel-based widths (`w-[150px]`, `min-w-[160px]`, `w-[100px]`, `w-[140px]`, `w-[180px]`) to other columns ('id', 'protocol_system', 'static_attributes.fee', 'spotPrice', 'updatedAt') to make them content-appropriate.

## Next Steps

*   No further immediate next steps for this specific task, as the column width alignment has been implemented and confirmed by the user.
*   The overall "Pool List View Refactor - Final Polish" still has remaining verification and thorough testing items as outlined in `progress.md`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Adherence to Figma design specifications for UI elements, including dynamic sizing.
*   Use of Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   Modular component design.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The Figma design for the "Pool list" table uses a mixed column sizing strategy (one column fills, others hug content) which requires a `table-auto` layout and specific width hints in Tailwind CSS for accurate implementation.
*   Previous "user's request" for uniform fixed width was overridden to achieve closer Figma alignment.
